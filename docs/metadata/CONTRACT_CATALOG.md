# Metadata Contract Catalog

## Purpose

This catalog makes OpenPilot's cross-module metadata surface reviewable without
requiring contributors to remember every model. The executable sources of truth
remain:

- `Code/src/metadata/base.py::MetadataKind` for canonical kinds;
- `Code/src/metadata/__init__.py::__all__` for the public contract surface;
- `Code/tests/test_metadata_models.py` for one-kind-per-model, envelope, and
  catalog-completeness invariants.

The catalog describes ownership and lifecycle boundaries. Field-level truth
comes from the Pydantic models themselves.

All additions and changes must follow
`docs/metadata/DEVELOPMENT_CONVENTIONS.md`. That document defines the mandatory
reuse/duplication review while preserving the currently implemented value-nested
architecture. This catalog answers “what exists”; the convention answers
“whether and how it may change.”

## Protocol invariants

Every concrete metadata model must:

- inherit `MetadataBase`;
- own exactly one `Literal[MetadataKind.*]` kind;
- preserve the common `source: MetadataSource` envelope field;
- serialize through `to_json_dict()` when crossing a module or persistence
  boundary;
- keep runtime-only objects outside the serialized protocol;
- be exported from `metadata.__all__` and listed in this catalog.

`source` is reserved for the producer/owner envelope. Domain provenance must
use a qualified name such as `path_source` or `signal_source`. Free-form
diagnostic extensions belong in `annotations`, `attributes`, `trace_info`, or
another explicitly scoped escape hatch; they must not silently replace an
existing typed field.

## Current inventory

There are 80 public concrete contracts, one for each `MetadataKind`.

| Family / owner | Contracts | Boundary and lifecycle |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Artifacts (`metadata/artifacts.py`) | `TextArtifactMetadata`, `CodeArtifactMetadata`, `FileArtifactMetadata`, `FileReadMode`, `FileReadWindow`, `CommandArtifactMetadata`, `SearchArtifactMetadata`, `EmbeddingArtifactMetadata` | Typed payloads produced by tools and routed to downstream tools, agents, UI, or persistence. `FileReadWindow` is an owned nested value describing one explicit bounded result; it is not a second file/source authority. |
| Result envelopes (`metadata/results.py`) | `FailureMetadata`, `ToolResultMetadata`, `TaskResultMetadata` | Success/failure envelopes for tool and task boundaries. `status`, `result`, and `failure` must remain mutually consistent. |
| Tool orchestration (`metadata/tooling.py`) | `ToolInputMetadata`, `FileReadWindowSpec`, `ToolSelectionMetadata`, `ToolContractMetadata`, `ToolChainMetadata`, `ToolContextMetadata`, `ToolCallMetadata`, `ToolErrorMetadata`, `ToolEventMetadata`, `ToolLoopMetadata` | Planner-to-router-to-executor contracts and the typed tool-loop trace. `FileReadWindowSpec` is a task-owned declaration of sufficient bounded evidence for a named source path. `ToolInputMetadata.artifact_ref` is a provider-only, checksum/source-linked handoff view for a generated code artifact; it never authorizes a mutation. After writer execution, the full `generated_unit` remains runtime-internal and post-mutation context carries only a bounded receipt plus the exact validation command. `ToolLoopMetadata.retry_count` and `fallback_count` are runner-derived recovery counters; a model-visible local protocol correction consumes one retry, and downstream receipts must not infer either counter from successful provider responses. Runtime handles are deliberately excluded from serialization. |
| Execution runtime (`metadata/runtime.py`) | `LLMRequestMetadata`, `LLMResponseMetadata`, `ExecutionContextMetadata`, `LogEventMetadata`, `ToolExecutionEnvelopeMetadata`, `AgentExecutionMetadata`, `ModuleExecutionMetadata` | LLM, execution, logging, and aggregate runtime envelopes. `ReasoningPolicy` and `ResolvedReasoningPolicy` are strict owned values inside LLM envelopes, not new public metadata kinds. These are execution observations, not autonomous state-machine ownership. |
| Agent runtime (`metadata/agent_runtime.py`) | `RuntimeBudgetMetadata`, `ProviderBudgetDiagnostic`, `ContextSelectionMetadata`, `EditPlanMetadata`, `VerificationPlanMetadata`, `PathIntentMetadata`, `PathResolutionMetadata`, `DecisionNeedMetadata`, `ToolDecisionMetadata`, `GuardDecisionMetadata`, `RuntimeStateMetadata`, `RuntimeCheckpointMetadata`, `RuntimeResumeDecisionMetadata`, `RuntimeReportMetadata` | Mutable phase-driven task state, strict per-attempt budget evidence, prompt-context selection, bounded tool/recovery and tool-event completion budgets, evidence-backed decisions, path grounding, durable recovery checkpoints and finalization cursor, explainable resume preflight, and the final derived report. `RuntimeTaskPurpose` distinguishes normal project completion from read-only response-evidence collection. `DecompositionPolicyDecision` is a strict cursor/state-owned value for single/initial/local/replan admission; neither is a new public metadata kind. `ContextSelectionMetadata.compaction_attempts` nests body-free `ContextCompactionAttempt` values owned by the same assembly snapshot; they distinguish provider acceptance from builder selection without creating a second compact authority. |
| Conversation iteration (`metadata/iteration.py`) | `IterationTurnRecordMetadata` | Durable conversation/run-owned pre-task control record. Strict owned values type disposition, authority ceiling, obligations, grounding, root budget, outcome, assistant ledger commit, and task binding. `IterationControlCursor.pending_provider_request` owns an admitted request until its transport result is determinate; `observed_provider_response_ref` then identifies the exact content-addressed response and is bound with the complete request descriptor by a reducer-derived progress signature. The two states are mutually exclusive, and neither grants replay authority. `ResponseCandidate.claim_manifest_ref` references a body-bearing ordered claim manifest used for evidence questions; the compact claim values remain the source/hash/classification owner. `CanonicalInitialTaskSnapshot` is an owned nested transition value containing the typed task graph, unsigned initial checkpoint, authority and root-budget facts needed for deterministic materialization. It never owns project-task success; response-only remains taskless, while active task truth stays in `RuntimeCheckpointMetadata`. |
| Entry routing (`metadata/routing.py`) | `TaskRouteMetadata` | UI/entry-point decision between supported execution routes. |
| Project and autonomy (`metadata/project.py`) | `ProjectStateMetadata`, `ProblemSignalMetadata`, `ProblemJudgmentMetadata`, `DifficultyAssessmentMetadata`, `ResolutionPlanMetadata`, `TaskGraphNodeMetadata`, `TaskGraphEdgeMetadata`, `ExecutionStateMetadata`, `ProductIntentMetadata`, `ProjectObjectiveMetadata`, `SuccessMetricMetadata`, `ProjectDimensionAssessmentMetadata`, `ReferenceInsightMetadata`, `ProjectDependencyMetadata`, `DependencyStrategyMetadata`, `ProjectStackPresetMetadata`, `FileContentSectionMetadata`, `FileContentIndexMetadata`, `DirectorySketchMetadata`, `TaskFileResolutionRequestMetadata`, `RelatedProjectFileMetadata`, `TaskFileResolutionMetadata`, `GitRepositoryMetadata`, `GitSnapshotMetadata`, `GitDiffContextMetadata`, `ImprovementCandidateMetadata`, `ProjectDiagnosisMetadata`, `ValidationIssueMetadata`, `ImprovementAnalysisMetadata`, `EnvironmentSyncMetadata`, `AutonomyDecisionMetadata` | Project facts, diagnosis, planning graph, file indexes, environment state, and improvement decisions shared across autonomy modules. Persist only the models required by the owning store or trajectory. |
| Bug and environment repair (`metadata/bugfix.py`) | `BugFixAttemptMetadata`, `BugFixResultMetadata`, `EnvironmentFailureMetadata`, `EnvironmentFixResultMetadata` | Bounded repair attempts and their final evidence. |
| Warning analysis (`metadata/warnings.py`) | `WarningItemMetadata`, `WarningCheckResultMetadata` | Structured warning classification and the aggregate warning-check result. |
| Generated-agent data flow (`metadata/data.py`) | `CollectedDataMetadata`, `ProcessedDataMetadata`, `PresentationMetadata` | Collection, processing, and presentation-stage exchange for generated agents. |

`ToolContractMetadata.conditional_requirements` is an owned contract field used
by provider schema derivation and admission. It is a derived view of the
existing `ToolInputMetadata` fields, not a second source of tool-input truth;
operation-specific omissions must fail closed before execution.

## Similar-looking contracts that are not currently duplicates

- `IterationTurnRecordMetadata` owns the interval before a project `Task` and
  its checkpoint exist. `SessionIngressState` continues to own raw conversation
  turns and constraint authority, while `RuntimeStateMetadata` and
  `RuntimeCheckpointMetadata` own active task truth. The iteration record binds
  those owners by identity, hashes, artifact references, and typed commit state;
  it does not copy an active runtime state or infer `core_success`.
- `ResponseClaim` owns claim identity, checksum, and source class inside the
  candidate. Its content-addressed claim manifest stores exact text needed by a
  later `DecisionNeed`; consumers verify one-to-one order, ID, hash, and source
  correspondence, so the artifact cannot reclassify or add claims.
- `RootDecisionBudget` is an owned pre-task value inside the iteration record.
  `RuntimeBudgetMetadata` remains the task/tool/enhancement budget owner. A
  materialization transition freezes both in `CanonicalInitialTaskSnapshot`;
  it does not share mutable counters, and the active checkpoint becomes the
  task budget owner after the binding commit.

- `ReasoningDecisionComplexity` is a typed request-owner routing input and is
  not a provider capability or a completion-budget authority. It separates
  reasoning complexity from `EnhancementCompletionComplexity`.
- `ReasoningPolicy` owns provider-neutral caller intent;
  `ResolvedReasoningPolicy` owns the capability-profile decision and transport
  semantics actually used. They are not two authorities: resolution is a
  deterministic derived value. `ReasoningCapabilityProfileId` and
  `ReasoningTransportFamily` are typed routing identities, while provider
  payload keys remain transport implementation details. The explicit
  `openai-chat-no-reasoning-known` profile is an opt-in OpenAI capability view
  for models that reject `reasoning_effort`; disabled reasoning is represented
  by omission in its derived payload.
- `ReasoningUsageObservation` is an owned response-side observation. A missing
  provider reasoning-token field remains `None` (unknown), not zero; it does
  not control routing or budgets and is not a second runtime-state authority.

- `EnvironmentSyncMetadata` is the sole project-environment lifecycle owner.
  Its typed operation/readiness fields control attachment and setup admission;
  `operations` and warnings are diagnostic only. Old payloads default to
  `legacy_sync + unknown`, never ready. `ProjectFingerprint.interpreter` and
  `environment_id` bind an already-ready observation to a checkpoint for resume
  comparison; they are not a second mutable environment state. Requested and
  effective command identities remain owned by `ToolInputMetadata`.

- `RuntimeStateMetadata` is mutable controller state;
  `RuntimeCheckpointMetadata` is an immutable persisted snapshot at a named
  recovery boundary;
  `RuntimeResumeDecisionMetadata` is the preflight decision for one explicit
  resume attempt;
  `RuntimeReportMetadata` is its final auditable projection;
  `ProjectStateMetadata` describes the target project rather than a task run.
- `RuntimeStateMetadata.task_purpose` controls task lifecycle/result semantics,
  not permission. `response_evidence` additionally requires typed read-only
  execution and disables core success, runtime report/finalization, project
  improvement, and `task_finished`; the existing execution mode/Guard/checkpoint
  owners still enforce capability admission.
- `DecompositionPolicyDecision` records why an existing session plan is either
  one bounded task or a Provider-decomposed graph. `SessionExecutionCursor`
  remains the sole plan/resume owner and binds the decision into its plan hash;
  task nodes remain the plan payload. Legacy cursors migrate explicitly to a
  `legacy_cursor` decision and legacy hash version rather than being re-decided.
- `RuntimeStateMetadata.session_constraints` is the single owner of the
  source-linked, in-session constraint ledger. `SessionConstraintProposal`,
  `SessionConstraintEntry`, and `SessionConstraintState` are strict nested
  values, not public Metadata kinds. Proposals never control execution;
  active/revoked entries preserve a per-key snapshot and revoked tombstones.
  `SessionConstraintLimits` is an owned typed bound for pending proposals,
  active/revoked entries, serialized values, and variant item counts. Newer
  same-key user proposals source-link and supersede older pending proposals;
  superseded proposals cannot be activated. Missing limits in historical
  checkpoints migrate to bounded defaults. `SessionConstraintState.canonical_hash`
  covers the complete persisted snapshot, including the ingress cursor, while
  its derived `authority_hash` excludes `processed_through_turn` and identifies
  the stable model-facing constraint projection; ordinary dialog noise therefore
  cannot stale an unchanged active-constraint candidate.
  `TaskGraphNodeMetadata.write_files` and `validation_command`,
  `RuntimeExecutionMode`, and existing guards remain the execution authorities;
  the session ledger can only narrow or project those facts. Assistant text,
  summaries, compact artifacts, and long-term memory cannot create authority.
- `ConversationIdentity`, `SessionTurn`, `SessionProjectScopeTransition`, and
  `SessionIngressState` are strict
  ingress values for the production conversation owner. They keep
  conversation identity distinct from a per-run checkpoint identity and hold
  pending proposals outside long-term memory; they do not add a public
  `MetadataKind` or replace the runtime ledger. `RuntimeCheckpointMetadata`
  nests a bounded `session_ingress_state` snapshot, requires its
  `identity.run_id` to equal checkpoint `session_id`, and rejects a checkpoint
  whose nested constraint snapshot diverges from `RuntimeStateMetadata`.
  The top-level `run_id` remains the diagnostic/checkpoint-store routing ID and
  is intentionally not equated with the ingress execution run ID.
  `SessionIngressState.initial_project_root` anchors project ownership, while a
  typed `SessionProjectScopeTransition` may advance only into a canonically
  resolved generated descendant. Historical turns retain their original root;
  discontinuous lineage, siblings, parents, unrelated paths, and histories over
  16 transitions fail closed.
- Recovery extends that existing runtime family rather than adding parallel
  public kinds. `RuntimeStateMetadata.recovery_status` is operational state;
  `RuntimeResumeDecisionMetadata` owns one attempt's recoverability, mode,
  automation policy, reason code, strict nested blockers, and fallback;
  `RuntimeReportMetadata` is a projection. `RecoveryBlocker` and
  `RecoveryFallback` are owned nested values, not independent contracts.
- `RuntimeCheckpointMetadata.session_cursor` owns the durable monolithic-session
  position. It reuses `TaskGraphNodeMetadata` for the decomposed plan and nests
  strict semantic/task-result cursor values; the plan hash and contiguous result
  rule prevent a controller from guessing the next subtask. It does not create a
  second public session metadata kind.
- `SessionBootstrapCursor`, `PendingLLMRequest`, `LLMReplayEntry`,
  `ReadToolReplayEntry`, and `DurableArtifactReference` are strict values owned
  by the checkpoint. They identify hashes, ordinals, calls, and integrity-checked
  artifacts needed for apply-once recovery; provider payloads and read contents
  live in the artifact store, not in a parallel state tree.
- `RuntimeBudgetMetadata` remains the single owner of both completion-accounting
  pools. The controller-decision pool and post-core enhancement pool are
  independent 12,000-token limits, not one global allowance. Enhancement
  policy/limit/request/reservation/reconciliation values and their complexity,
  decision-value, and requirement enums are strict owned nested values; they
  add no `MetadataKind`. Reservation ledger keys are stable logical call keys,
  reconciliation keys are reservation IDs, and aggregate counters must match
  those ledgers after checkpoint restoration. Provider usage and finish reason
  remain execution evidence; reconciliation is only the budget projection, not
  a second provider fact source. The pool governs planning, full-file generation,
  and localized `code_edit`; historical four-purpose policy values migrate by
  adding the bounded `code_edit` limit. `EnhancementCompletionRequirement` applies to
  one model call, while `ProjectImprovementPolicy` remains the stage/top-level
  success authority. Its optional `ToolEventCompletionOutcome` snapshot is
  runtime-only budget feedback: when explicitly enabled, empty or truncated
  provider responses may grant one bounded recovery step; it never creates an
  unbounded ceiling or a second reasoning-policy authority. Historical/default
   instances keep this feedback disabled.
- `ProviderBudgetDiagnostic` is a strict derived per-provider-attempt view owned
  by the tool round-trip result. It preserves requested/reserved/known-or-unknown
  usage, finish/outcome/cap facts, route flag, and typed failure class without
  becoming a second budget authority or storing raw provider error text.
- `RuntimePromptContextSnapshot` is a strict value owned by
  `RuntimeCheckpointMetadata`. It binds the complete context request hash and
  rendered Prompt hash to the existing `ContextSelectionMetadata` and one
  checksum-verified `prompt_context` artifact. Raw memory/project/dialog stores
  remain authoritative for candidates; the artifact is the immutable selected
  input for that model call, not a second memory store.
- `VerificationStatus` and `CheckpointStatus` are strict control enums rather
  than public metadata kinds. Human recovery explanations remain strings only
  because they do not control branching.
- `CheckpointBoundary` is the single typed registry for durable checkpoint
  names. `CheckpointFaultPoint` types runtime-only deterministic write-before
  and write-after test hooks; the hook itself is never serialized.
- `RuntimeCheckpointMetadata.finalization_cursor` owns the monotonic
  `state_completed -> report_persisted -> run_finalized` progress. It reuses
  `DurableArtifactReference` for the checksum-verified report and records the
  completion event ID as projection evidence. `RuntimeReportMetadata.state_hash`
  binds the derived report to completed task state; neither value duplicates
  authoritative runtime state. `FinalizationFaultPoint` is test-only.
- `RuntimeStateMetadata.execution_mode` is root-task permission state. Its
  source and reason explain who established the boundary; subtask tags are not
  authoritative producers. `guard_history` stores typed routing decisions for
  audit and failure propagation, not an alternative permission source.
- `ProjectImprovementPolicy` and its requirement/source enums are strict owned
  runtime values, not new Metadata kinds. Configuration produces this policy
  once; legacy enable/count/attempt fields are compatibility views. Runtime
  state/report preserve the same value with `core_success` and the typed
  improvement status so optional enhancement failure cannot overwrite core
  execution facts.
- `Task.write_files` remains planned intent. Observed file mutations flow from
  successful mutation tool results into runtime state and
  `ExecutionStateMetadata.changed_files`; these fields are deliberately not
  interchangeable.
- `Task.support_context_files` and
  `TaskGraphNodeMetadata.support_context_files` are model-facing support
  identities. They are not read authority, write authority, validation
  evidence, or observed file state. Provider-native execution may derive
  body-free required `ContextCandidate` metadata from them, while read admission
  and writer routing continue to use `Task.read_files` only.
- `ImprovementAnalysisMetadata.evidence_ids` links a bounded improvement delta
  to retained context candidates from the exact provider request. The model may
  propose IDs, but runtime filtering is authoritative; unknown or omitted
  candidate IDs are discarded. `DesignedImprovementTask.evidence_ids` is the
  local autonomous-iteration equivalent and is not a second evidence store.
  Its provider-facing contract accepts only exact `[evidence_id="..."]` header
  values; goal, diagnosis-candidate, task, source, and content-embedded IDs are
  distinct identity domains and are never interpreted as context evidence.
- `RuntimeCheckpointMetadata.pending_verification` is the typed, still-required
  validation plan known before a file mutation. `VerificationCommandSpec`,
  `next_command_index`, and the strict `completed_commands` prefix extend that
  existing owner for bounded ordered validation; completed commands are not
  reconstructed from path evidence or free-form summaries.
- `resume_attempt_id` identifies one execution attempt, while
  `resume_source_checkpoint_id` identifies the immutable checkpoint selected as
  its state source. Retrying an older generation appends after the run's current
  latest generation and never overwrites the intervening history.
- `ToolCallMetadata` is a requested invocation, and its optional
  `provider_call_id` is an external wire correlation value; it never replaces
  the project-owned `call_id` used by permissions, budgets, checkpoints, or
  recovery. `ToolErrorMetadata` is a
  protocol/execution failure, and `ToolEventMetadata` is the lifecycle event
  that may embed either. Their repeated correlation fields are intentional for
  standalone trajectory records.
- `AgentExecutionMetadata` and `ModuleExecutionMetadata` share an execution
  envelope but identify different ownership levels. Consolidation should wait
  until producers and consumers demonstrate identical lifecycle semantics.
- Artifact subclasses share text fields because code and files can flow through
  text-oriented consumers while retaining a discriminated kind.

## Known pressure points

- `ToolInputMetadata` is a broad compatibility contract with many optional
  fields. Do not add another field until the target tool contract, producer,
  and consumer are identified. Prefer a dedicated input model only when a real
  boundary can adopt it end to end.
- `ToolInputMetadata.session_turn_source_hash` is the identified typed
  evidence field for a model-facing dialog projection. It is a derived replay
  digest only; raw `SessionIngressState` remains the authority and is never
  replaced by this hash.
- `attributes`, `annotations`, `raw_payload`, `details`, `trace_info`, and other
  `JsonValue` containers weaken schema guarantees. They are appropriate for
  diagnostics or provider-specific data, but not for facts that control routing,
  permissions, recovery, or completion.
- Permission branching now uses the typed `execution_mode` and
  `execution_mode_source` enums. The legacy read-only assumption marker is a
  historical-read migration input only and must not be produced by new
  subtask planning.
- Several project-analysis models contain nested free-form dictionaries. Type
  them incrementally when more than one module depends on the same shape; avoid
  speculative mass conversion.
- Schema version `1.0` is currently global. A breaking persisted-shape change
  requires an explicit read migration or a version change before old data is
  written back.

## Change checklist

Before adding or changing a metadata field, record:

1. The fact being represented and why an existing field cannot represent it.
2. The authoritative producer and every known consumer.
3. Whether it is runtime-only, trajectory evidence, or durable project state.
4. Whether it controls branching, permissions, recovery, or completion.
5. Default and optionality semantics; avoid using empty strings and `None` for
   different undocumented meanings.
6. Serialization, historical-read, and deprecation behavior.
7. Tests for round-trip serialization, invalid input, boundary conditions, and
   affected state transitions.
8. Required updates to `API.md`, this catalog, and task-trajectory documentation.

Deprecation proceeds in order: stop new producers, migrate consumers, preserve
historical reads, remove the old field, and finally remove its compatibility
path. Do not merge similar models solely because their field names overlap.

## Context-management alignment

Context selection should reuse these contracts rather than copying entire raw
payloads. A context decision is explainable only when the trajectory can recover:

- the applicable budget and usage before/after selection;
- the source contract or artifact considered;
- the keep, summarize, truncate, or discard decision;
- the reason and resulting size;
- the checkpoint used for recovery after interruption.

`MemoryContextBuilder` adapts each fixed instruction, dialog message, project
file, memory record, and environment observation into an individual
`ContextCandidate` with stable candidate/source identity, while
`memory.context_assembly.ContextAssembler` produces the bounded view and emits
`ContextSelectionMetadata` because this decision controls model-facing input and crosses
the memory, autonomous-iteration, and trajectory boundaries. The assembler is not a
second source store and introduces no additional Metadata contract. The contract records
whether character or exact provider
token budgeting controlled selection, tokenizer/model identity, original/final
character and token sizes, candidate decisions, and the contiguous recent-dialog
selection boundary. Historical section decisions are a compatibility projection
derived from candidate decisions, not a second selection authority. The selected
source entries remain available to non-model
  consumers. Project improvement analysis, Goal Maker, and Task Designer now
  project required control candidates separately from optional file/history
  evidence instead of copying a complete ProjectState/report message. Contextual
  code generation follows the same ownership rule: `Task` / `ToolInputMetadata`,
  `CodeGenerationRequest`, and `ProductIntentMetadata` retain their authoritative
  facts while a stateless adapter derives `ContextCandidate` values. Required
  current source is never truncated for an existing-file replacement; optional
  diagnosis/environment/judgment are bounded summaries. This is a derived view,
  not a new Metadata kind or second permission/task owner.

Provider tool-call round trips use the same candidate contract: assistant
tool-call messages and `role=tool` results are structured, required,
non-truncatable projections whose source IDs and provider call IDs remain
available for replay. The `tool` role is a model-facing projection only; typed
tool events and execution records remain authoritative for side effects.
The runtime-only Provider attempt ledger derives the one-repair/no-progress
decision from typed error kinds and normalized call signatures; it is not a
second persisted tool-error owner. Permission, confirmation, scope, checkpoint,
and verification facts remain owned by admission, Guard, and runtime state.

Candidate governance reuses these owned nested contracts. `ContextCandidate`
may classify projection trust and freshness and may name an explicit
`conflict_key`; `ContextAssemblyPolicy` controls exact-duplicate, stale, and
explicit-conflict handling; `ContextCandidateDecision` records the governed
reason and winning candidate. `ContextSelectionMetadata` uses
`governance_blocked` only when required candidates cannot be governed safely.
Defaults keep historical serialized values readable. No semantic contradiction
is inferred from free text, embeddings, tags, or confidence, and no source memory
is mutated by this derived selection pass.

Dialog compaction is represented by the narrow owned nested
`ContextCompactionRecord` / `ContextCompactionBinding` values. The record names
the exact non-required dialog candidate IDs, source fingerprint, deterministic
algorithm, summary, and before/after sizes; the binding requires a
`context_compaction` `DurableArtifactReference` and may carry the body-free
source-binding hash for newly produced bindings. Historical bindings without the
hash remain readable but cannot prove reusable-admission source stability on
their own. An `artifact` candidate alone may name `compacted_candidate_ids`, and
each compacted source decision links back to it.
`RuntimePromptContextSnapshot.compaction_bindings` defaults empty for historical
checkpoints and makes checksum validation part of recovery preflight.
Raw dialog remains authoritative; the exact prompt-context artifact remains the
replay authority.
The record accepts historical `deterministic_dialog_extract_v1` and current
`deterministic_observation_mask_v1` algorithms. Algorithm changes do not change
source ownership. A compactor that cannot be kept completely must not govern its
sources out of the assembled request.
Compaction candidates must forbid truncation and cannot be nested or cyclic.
Current observation compaction is limited to assistant dialog projections; user
dialog and required candidates remain outside this algorithm's legal source set.
The optional `ContextCompactionSummary` is a strict derived value for the
feature-flagged `llm_rolling_summary_v1` algorithm. It is source-evidence linked,
bounded by a separate summary token ceiling, and carries no task, permission,
write-scope, or verification authority. Unknown usage, incomplete finish
evidence, stale source fingerprints, or a summary that displaces the recent
suffix restore the deterministic source view. Raw dialog and checkpoint
artifacts remain authoritative.

`ContextSelectionMetadata.compaction_attempts` is an optional, body-free
diagnostic projection for the same assembly pass. Each attempt independently
records provider acceptance, trial selection, source/summary fingerprints and
sizes, recent-suffix displacement IDs, typed trial decision, and artifact-sink
outcome. `generated_observed_only` means the provider summary fit the trial but
the observation sink returned no artifact; it is never authority or prompt
content. These fields are excluded from request identity and remain optional so
older receipts and checkpoints continue to parse.

`ContextSelectionMetadata.compaction_reuse_admissions` is an optional,
body-free shadow projection for considering an already generated compaction
artifact. It records source IDs/fingerprint, source binding hash, required and
recent guard IDs, session-constraint hash, artifact identity/checksum, typed
admission status, and typed rejection reason. The current contract is
shadow-only: `ContextCompactionReuseAdmission.used_in_prompt` must remain
`false`, and an admitted value does not create a `ContextCompactionBinding` or
govern source omissions. Raw dialog and the prompt-context artifact remain the
authoritative replay sources. `MemoryContextBuilder` can produce these values
only through an explicitly injected default-off shadow provider that receives
body-free digests and hashes; the provider cannot alter prompt text or request
identity. The memory-layer artifact source adapter may construct that provider
from explicit body-free reusable compaction candidates or from existing
`ContextCompactionBinding` values after reducing them to identity/checksum,
source binding hashes, guard IDs, and generated-summary fingerprint; it does
not retain summary text. Checkpoint discovery from
`RuntimePromptContextSnapshot.compaction_bindings` uses the persisted
`ContextCompactionBinding.source_binding_hash` when present. An external
body-free source-binding hash index is only a compatibility input for
historical bindings that lack the field; conflicts with a persisted hash fail
closed as `artifact_contract_invalid`. The runtime must not recompute a current
source hash and treat it as the old binding fact. The field defaults empty for
historical reads. Reusable prompt-use preflight remains a memory-layer
runtime-only dry run: it validates source binding, artifact integrity,
required/recent retention, deterministic semantic-fact coverage, and trial
assembly without changing the real prompt or altering the shadow-only
`ContextCompactionReuseAdmission` contract. The follow-on prompt-use simulation
is also runtime-only: it compares raw assembly with an in-memory reusable
projection using hashes, character counts and candidate IDs, requires exact
`compacted` governed source replacement, required/recent retention and positive
prompt-character reduction, and still does not mutate production prompts or
make `used_in_prompt=true` legal. If a token counter and token budget are
explicitly supplied, the runtime-only simulation may also record token counts
and token deltas. These are derived canary-accounting fields, not provider
usage/billing facts and not a new metadata authority.

`ContextSelectionMetadata.compaction_reuse_shadow_failures` is an optional,
body-free nested diagnostic owned by the same assembly snapshot. It records only
`provider_exception`, `provider_empty`, or `invalid_provider_result`, plus a
bounded exception type when applicable. Non-strict builder fallback preserves the
existing prompt and selection; strict source mode raises the existing
`context_compaction_reuse` error instead of returning a failure value. The
diagnostic has no routing, permission, budget, or prompt authority and remains
readable as an empty list for historical snapshots.

`ContextQualityExpectation` and `ContextQualityEvaluation` are strict offline
owned values, not runtime Metadata owners. Fixture authors explicitly name
expected selected/omitted candidate IDs; the stateless evaluator reports typed
structural issue codes and references selection evidence. It does not mutate the
assembly, control routing, copy source facts, or infer semantic relevance. These
values therefore do not justify a new `MetadataKind` or persisted runtime field.

The current typed policy identity is `retention_priority_order_v1`. Historical
`priority_then_recency_v1` and section decisions remain readable for compatibility,
but production builders have zero calls to legacy section assembly or the
standalone compressor.

The selected payload is persisted as a checksum artifact at the typed
`context_assembled` boundary. `RuntimePromptContextSnapshot` carries its request
hash, Prompt hash, selection record, and artifact reference with the session
bootstrap/cursor. Resume replays it only for the identical request and fails
closed on artifact/hash mismatch. Omitted candidates still belong to their
memory/project stores and are not copied into checkpoint state.

`ContextSelectionMetadata` does not copy `LLMResponse.usage`: the former is the
pre-request count of the bounded context slice, while provider usage is the
post-request authority for the complete serialized request and billing. If the
configured tokenizer is unavailable, token fields remain absent and
`token_count_method=unavailable`; no heuristic count controls the token budget.

Typed cross-module adapters use owned strict values rather than new Metadata
kinds: `ContextCandidate` describes one source projection and its typed control
policy; `ContextAssemblyPolicy` owns one selection budget; `ContextCandidateDecision`
records the derived per-candidate outcome; and `ContextAssemblyResult` returns
the selected projections with the existing `ContextSelectionMetadata` owner.
`DerivedContextProjection` is an owned nested view of one ready assembly for
downstream purpose adapters. It carries only selected dialog/artifact candidates
plus request, session-turn, constraint, and projection hashes. Raw ingress and
source stores remain authoritative; a downstream adapter must reject stale or
incomplete selected candidates and must not reintroduce compacted source IDs
into a second assembler.
`assembly_status=budget_insufficient` is required when a `required` candidate is
omitted. These values do not own memory, file, artifact, task, or runtime source
facts and must preserve available source IDs instead of becoming a second store.

For provider-ready requests, `ContextSelectionMetadata` distinguishes the
requested prompt budget, explicit framing/safety reserve, effective content
allowance (`max_prompt_tokens`), exact selected content tokens, and remaining
allowance. `LLMRequest.context_selection` and `LLMRequestMetadata.context_selection`
carry this same owned record through transport diagnostics and replay hashing;
